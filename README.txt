This folder contains an example of a simple data science workflow you can use as a reference
for the data science project. This files are merely a guideline and we do not guarantee they
are syntactically or logically correct, we do not reccomend copying them blindly.

You will find a bunch of files. All of them except titanic.py are part of the workflow,
and show you how you can structure a python project to make it more readable and maintainable.
Clearly, you can decide to put all of your code in one single script, as was done in tianic.py.

Remember to write readable code and to use python coding conventions (PEP 8).

If you have any question feel free to send an email at fintech@lumsa.it.
